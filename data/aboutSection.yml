  ### Who am I?

  I am someone who feels truly alive when solving problems — even the small ones — and creating solutions that make a difference.
  Art and design feed my soul, bringing me calm and joy, while the act of crafting meaningful experiences gives me a sense of purpose.
  Being at the intersection of problem-solving and creativity is where I thrive, and that’s the energy I bring to every project I work on.
