  ## About me

  ### Who am I?

  I feel alive when I solve problems, big or small, and find simple solutions.
  I love art, nature, and plants.
  
  
  Through experience, Iâ€™ve learned that working part-time from home, spreading my hours through the day, helps my creativity.
  Freelancing lets me mix focus with flexibility and enjoy what I do.
