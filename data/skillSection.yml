  ## How can I help you?

  I can help you from the first step when you have an idea. 
  First, I'll understand your goal, market, and user needs to use them to create the prototype.
   Then we will check and test the prototypes to understand problems and solve them early, this step could be repeated several times. 
   After all, I'll design the product with details and test it again to make sure there is no problem.
