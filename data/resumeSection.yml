      WITS · Freelance 

      #### Product Designer

      WITS is a Telegram mini app designed as a competition platform where Web3 projects can engage users by showcasing product features through interactive contests.
      The platform helps teams increase awareness and user familiarity with their products in a gamified environment.

      At WITS, I served as the Product Designer, leading the end-to-end design process.
      This included wireframing, creating the UI kit, building high-fidelity prototypes, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
      A key focus of my work was integrating gamification elements to make the product engaging, while carefully balancing scope to deliver a lightweight MVP.
      This approach allowed the team to launch quickly and gather valuable user feedback for future iterations.
      In addition to the mini app, I also designed a dedicated landing page to present the game and attract participants.
