ShortDescription: I set out to design an intuitive, user-friendly car-hailing app that guides users step-by-step for a seamless booking experience. My goal was to simplify and streamline the process from ordering to drop-off.

Challenge: Existing apps tend to have complex menus and flows that are confusing to navigate. I wanted to create a clean, minimalist interface for quickly getting a ride.

Solution: I focused on walking users through each task in a simplified, guided flow using large visual elements, clear typography, and straightforward screens. This aims to reduce friction and stress for ordering a car.
