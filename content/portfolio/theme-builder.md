service: UX Research, UX Design
client: Digify
shortDescription: As Digify expanded, our theme customization panel was too limited for the greater flexibility needed across themes. We designed a dedicated theme builder to offer robust customization options now and in the future.

Challenge: Our existing panel couldn't support extensive theme customization and modifications as more themes were added. We needed a new platform flexible enough for current and future themes.

Solution: We built a new standalone theme builder focused on usability and extensibility. Fashion and other theme templates provide the base, while the builder offers unlimited combinations of colors, layouts, and design elements. This positions us to easily expand customization as Digify grows.
