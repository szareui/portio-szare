shortDescription: To help facilitate online sales for small and large sellers per Digify's goals, we designed a new tool called "Paprika" to address a major challenge faced by some in this community. These sellers have Instagram store pages but are dissatisfied with sales or feel their products lack visibility. Paprika is a web app that aggregates Instagram posts from registered store pages to increase their reach.

Challenge: Many Instagram shop pages exist, but it's difficult to find specific products or compare prices across them. The aim was to consolidate these pages onto one easy-to-use platform.

Solution: We designed the interface to mirror Instagram for familiarity. However, changes were needed to enable easier product search, price visibility, and seller contact. This resulted in a search-based platform that makes key information and actions more accessible.
