ShortDescription: This project was a collaboration between professors at Yazd University to develop a remote ECG monitoring system. It uses a wearable device to transmit heart signal data via Bluetooth to an Android app I developed for receiving and displaying the data.

Challenge: Patients often struggle to visit clinics for routine ECGs. We aimed to create a small, lightweight device patients could wear to remotely send heart data to their doctors from home, increasing accessibility.

Solution: I worked on connecting the wearable ECG device to an Android app and enabling real-time data transmission and display. The app successfully receives and visualizes the heart signal data sent wirelessly from the patient device, helping doctors monitor their patients' health remotely.

This project was my first experience of  designing a real app. Befor that I've had been just a developer.
